# wtc

**One task. One workspace. All your repositories.**

Git worktree collections for working across repositories, with agents or your favorite editor.

A **worktree collection** puts the repositories needed for one task in a single
folder: your API, frontend, shared library, and optionally a project-owned
harness. Each repository keeps its own Git history. Start another task alongside
it with separate worktrees and ports.

WTC organizes the workspace, environment, agent guidance, and PR status. Your
projects keep their ordinary build and test commands. Agents, mise, and a special
editor are optional.

## Install and try it

You need Git and macOS or Linux. Download a [published binary](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/releases), or use mise:

```sh
mise use -g github:lcorneliussen/wtc-cli@0.1.58
wtc --version
```

**Local terminal:** start in an empty folder and replace these synthetic repositories with your own:

```sh
mkdir fix-login && cd fix-login
wtc init
wtc add-repo git@github.com:example-org/api.git
wtc add-repo ~/code/web
wtc status
cd api
git switch -c fix-login
```

Worktrees start detached at their target branch; create a branch in each repository
you change before committing. No harness is required. Continue with the
[handbook](https://wtc.sh/docs/getting-started/) or the
[repository setup guide](docs/getting-started.md).

**OpenClaw gateway:** do not run `wtc init` or `wtc new`. Ask the agent to start
a managed collection. Read [Under OpenClaw](https://wtc.sh/docs/openclaw/) and
the [gateway integration reference](docs/openclaw.md). An agent setting up WTC
should start with [`wtc docs setup.md`](internal/wtc/defaults/setup.md).
