# Driving collections with herdr

herdr is a terminal multiplexer for coding agents: panes survive detach, and
it reports whether the agent in a pane is working, idle, or blocked. That is
how several wtcs stay in flight at once. Optional, like mise — every other
tool works without it.

It is **ergonomics only**. A workspace is a view onto worktrees that already
exist; closing it must cost nothing (`AGENTS.md` → "State lives in git").

## Shape

```text
session "<project>"                one server + socket per workspace root
└─ workspace "<collection>"   one per wtc; cwd = collection root, .env.collection loaded
```

**Wide** (default when the attached client is wide enough):

```text
[ agent | browse ]     ← two stacked columns
[ shell | status ]     shell 20% height, status 35%
```

**Narrow** (`--narrow`, `WTC_LAYOUT=narrow`, or auto when session width <
`WTC_LAYOUT_NARROW_AT`, default 140):

```text
tab main:   agent / status     (stacked; status 35%)
tab tools:  browse / shell     (stacked; shell 20%)
```

Layout is applied on create. Explicit `--narrow` / `--wide` **switches** an
existing workspace (live panes are moved). A partial
workspace — common when you start the agent first, then open — is built out
toward the resolved layout. `auto` never flips a complete wide ↔ narrow.
`--wide` / `--narrow` override `WTC_LAYOUT` (and auto).

`browse` is the slot for something a human should look at. An agent that
wants to open neovim sends it there and keeps talking in `agent`. A command
typed at a prompt — herdr shell or a plain terminal — runs in that window;
it does not bounce into `browse`.

## Reaching a collection's agent from your phone

`wtc open` starts claude with **Remote Control** by default, so every
collection's agent shows up in the Claude mobile app and on claude.ai under
`<session>--<collection>`. A wtc agent is meant to keep working while you are
elsewhere; one you can only reach by walking back to this machine gives up
half of that.

The catch worth knowing before you need it: **Claude only accepts
`--remote-control` at start time.** There is no in-session toggle, so an agent
already running without it cannot be attached to your phone — it has to be
restarted, resuming its conversation:

```bash
cd <collection>
claude --remote-control "$WTC_AGENT_NAME" --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue
```

`--no-remote-control` opts out for one open; passing `--agent-args` replaces the
default arguments entirely and so drops it too.

Re-running `wtc open` inspects every pane and only (re)starts what is
sitting at a bare prompt — that is how a session restored after a reboot gets
its commands back. A workspace that already grew extra panes (a second agent,
a one-off split) is left alone, and browse tools fall back to `shell` rather
than inserting another column.

A session is a separate server with its own workspace list, so other work on
the machine never shows up here. The name defaults to the workspace-root
folder minus a trailing `-wtc` or `-harness` — so `<project>-wtc/` → session
**`<project>`**; override with `--session` or `$HARNESS_HERDR_SESSION`.

```bash
wtc open [<collection> …]             # this collection, or the named ones
wtc open --narrow                     # switch to (or create) stacked tabs
wtc open --wide                       # switch to (or create) stacked columns
wtc open --all --list                 # report every collection's agent state
herdr --session <project>                  # attach
```

Opening is idempotent and repairs a wtc whose agent exited. The session starts
headless on demand, so opening never steals a terminal. `wtc new` joins
a **running** session automatically (`--open` starts one, `--no-open` skips),
and `retire.sh` closes the workspace with the collection.

Claude panes start with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: a wtc is an isolated
worktree on its own branch with no production credentials. `--agent-args`
overrides, `--no-agent` skips the agent.

## Status

`tools/wtc-status.sh` prints each collection's branch, open PR with its check
rollup (`✓ ✗ ● —`), and working-tree state, then the processes running under
the session with CPU and memory.

`wtc open` puts a `status` pane in every wtc, scoped to that collection —
including wtcs opened before the pane existed, so re-running adds it without
disturbing the agent. For the process view, run it wherever you want it:

```bash
tools/wtc-status.sh --procs --watch 5
tools/wtc-status.sh --repos --watch 120   # all collections at once
```

The collection table is **clickable** wherever it has a terminal on both
ends (`--no-click` turns that off, `--click` forces it on):

| Click | Does |
|---|---|
| the `REPO` cell | focuses that sibling in the browse nvim (vim tab + neo-tree) |
| the `PR` cell | `:Octo pr edit` in that tab, or the pull request in the browser |
| the `TREE` cell | neo-tree git status in that tab; `lazygit` in a `diff:<repo>` herdr tab if nvim is not up |

`r` redraws, `q` quits. Clickable cells are underlined. The pane captures
the mouse while it runs, so herdr's own selection and wheel scrolling in that
pane give way to the table — close the diff tabs yourself when done; the
status pane never closes anything.

## Browse

`wtc browse` opens **one** LazyVim with **one vim tab per sibling**
(`:tcd` so gitsigns / neo-tree / Octo / lazygit see that repo). Tabs are
LazyVim **bufferline** in `tabs` mode (click a tab, or `gt` / `gT`).
`<leader><space>` / `<leader>ff` and `<leader>/` / `<leader>sg` search
**every sibling**; `<leader>fF` / `<leader>sG` stay in the current repo.
`<leader>fp` picks a repo tab. Tab 1 is a **live change tree** (changed
files only, fully expanded) of every sibling vs its PR base / `default_ref`.
It refreshes every 2s and, with follow on (`f` to toggle), peeks the
file the agent just wrote. `<CR>` peeks, `o` opens in the repo tab.
`<leader>gd` returns to the index; `]f`/`[f` walk files; `<leader>gD`
is Diffview side-by-side. The multi-repo map stays in the `status` pane.

Where it opens:

| Launched from | Goes |
|---|---|
| a terminal, including a herdr `shell` pane | this window |
| a coding agent inside herdr | the `browse` pane (or `shell`, if the workspace is off-template), plus a sibling herdr tab `pr` running `gh dash` if that extension is installed |

The browse nvim listens on
`/tmp/wtc-browse-<workspace-basename>-<collection>.nvim`. Long names are
shortened and checksummed to fit the platform socket-path limit. Status-pane
clicks talk to it:

| Click | Does |
|---|---|
| `REPO` | switch to that sibling's vim tab |
| `TREE` | that tab, neo-tree git status (lazygit tab if nvim is down) |
| `PR` | `:Octo pr edit` in that tab, else the PR in the browser |

```bash
wtc browse              # this collection
wtc browse --here       # this terminal, even from an agent pane
```

A status pane opened before clicking existed keeps running the old command
(nothing here restarts a live pane). Re-run the command in that pane when you
want it, or open a new wtc.

For an interactive look at what the agents are actually running, bind a
process monitor to a popup — full screen, closes on exit, layout untouched:

```toml
[[keys.command]]                 # ~/.config/herdr/config.toml
key = "prefix+alt+t"
type = "popup"
command = "btop"
```

## What to run in a pane

`herdr pane run` is not a better `bash`: a pane gives screen text, not an exit
code, and alternate-screen programs read back badly. Anything whose *result*
you act on — tests, builds, git — runs directly in the agent's own shell.

Panes are for processes that outlive the turn or that a human should watch:
dev servers, `docker compose up`, watch-mode runners, log tails, and TUIs
(`wtc-browse.sh`, lazygit) which belong in `browse`. A dev server in a pane is
also findable via `herdr pane list`, so the next agent doesn't start a
second copy on the same port.

### Write it relative

Every command a tool types into a pane is **relative to the collection root**,
which is that pane's cwd: `./harness/tools/wtc-status.sh --repos`,
`./harness/tools/wtc-browse.sh --here`, a bare `lazygit` in a pane opened at
the worktree. No absolute paths, and no collection argument where the tool
already defaults to the collection it runs from. A pane's shell history is
then a set of commands anyone can re-run in any collection, rather than a
record of one machine's directory layout.

### Agent names

An agent is named **`<session>--<collection>`** — `wtc--billing-api`. That
string is emitted as `WTC_AGENT_NAME` in `.env.collection` (and injected into
every pane); `wtc open` starts with `herdr agent start "$WTC_AGENT_NAME" …`,
so the command shape is the same across collections and only the env differs.
herdr caps names at 32 characters (`[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}`, unique among live
agents); longer names are shortened with a stable collection-specific suffix.
A collection named for a GitHub issue (`239-timeline-…`) is fine:
the session half starts with a letter, and if the session itself does not it
gets a `w` prefix. One string then reads the same in the collection env, in
`herdr agent list`, in Claude's Remote Control list, and on the phone.
`--session` overrides recompute the name when it would no longer match.

Commands that address a running agent (`agent prompt`, `agent wait`) take a
name **or a pane id** — prefer the pane id. A name only exists while the agent
herdr started is still that pane's occupant.

## Subagents vs. herdr agents

Subagents are ephemeral workers inside one task — shared context, structured
results, cheap. They stay the default for parallel work inside a wtc.

A herdr agent is a separate full session with its own context and wtc. Start
one only when the work is genuinely separate. **The prompt is ignition, not
the record:** put the assignment in an issue, branch, or `HANDOFF.md` first and
let the prompt point at it, so a dead agent costs nothing.

The collection's own agent gets its ignition from `wtc open`: on a
collection whose `HANDOFF.md` is still present it submits `/wtc-start` the
moment the agent is ready, and does not take the send on trust — a slash
command typed into Claude opens its command palette, where the first Enter
completes the command instead of sending it, so the text can sit in the chat
entry looking submitted. `wtc open` waits for the agent to be seen working and
supplies the missing Enter when herdr reports the submission stalled.

```bash
tools/branch-off.sh --issue api-1234 paging-clamp --open
herdr --session <project> agent prompt api-1234-paging-clamp \
  "Read HANDOFF.md at the wtc root, then start." --wait
```

## Never kill running state

Panes hold live work — an agent mid-task, a server, a test run — and an agent
conversation that dies is not recoverable from git. So: **no closing panes or
workspaces, no `session stop`, no restarting an agent, to apply a change.**
Add non-destructively and let re-running `wtc open` heal the workspace; it
is written to repair in place for exactly this reason. If something genuinely
cannot be fixed without killing a running pane, **ask the person first** —
it is their session, and "it was only idle" is not yours to judge.

## Traps

- **Panes inherit the server's environment.** A server started from inside an
  agent's shell hands that agent's env to every pane — a claude pane then
  inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` and runs with transcript saving off.
  `herdr_ensure_session` strips agent variables at server start; an already
  polluted server needs `herdr session stop`, and its panes must be recreated
  (restore reuses each pane's original environment).
- **Agent state accuracy** needs `herdr integration install claude` once per
  machine; without it, `blocked`/`done` are guesses.
