description: Bring another repository into an existing worktree collection as a sibling worktree, cloning its bare owner from GitHub if needed and running its init hook. Use when a task turns out to need a repo that is not checked out in the current collection, when the user asks to add a repo, service, or frontend to the workspace, or when a cross-repo change needs a second sibling.

# Add a repo to a live wtc

Collections start scoped to what the task looked like at the beginning. When
it turns out to need another repo, add it — that is cheaper and more correct
than a second collection or a stray clone somewhere else on disk.

## 1. Check it isn't already there

Siblings are subdirectories of the collection root named after the repo. The
full inventory of what *could* be added is `harness/.harness-repos.yml`; the
name you pass is the registry `name`, not the GitHub slug.

If the repo is not in the registry at all, this is a different job — it has to
be registered first (remote, `default_ref`, a unique `port_offset` if it
serves, `issues_prefix` if it owns issues), then `refresh-configs.sh` re-run.

## 2. Add it

```bash
harness/tools/add-repo.sh <collection> <repo> [<repo> …]
```

Run from any harness worktree; `<collection>` is the collection's directory
name under the workspace root, not a path.

Default: the new worktree is **detached at the repo's `default_ref`** — no
branch. A repo added purely for context (reading a sibling's code, checking an
API shape) then never grows a branch at all and needs no cleanup. If it does
turn out to need changes, `git switch -c <issue-id>-<slug>` at the first
commit.

- `-b <branch>` — check out a real branch instead. An existing branch of that
  name is used; otherwise it is created from `default_ref`. Use it when
  picking up a branch someone else pushed.
- `--tip` — accepted and ignored; detached at the tip is the default now.

The tool clones a missing bare owner from GitHub first, then runs the new
repo's init hook. The collection env already carries every registry repo's
port, so nothing needs re-wiring.

## 3. Wire the rest

```bash
harness/tools/link-secrets.sh --repo <repo>
```

The init hook normally does this itself, but hooks are per repo and a repo
without one links nothing. A nonzero exit means a target is not gitignored —
fix the ignore rule in that repo first, never work around it.

## 4. Before changing anything in it

Read the new sibling's own `AGENTS.md`. Branch policy, working branch, and
commit restrictions are per repo and this one's may differ from what the
collection has been following — `ops` especially stays
read-only-prod with its own rules.

Each repo's branch is created at its own first commit, so a sibling whose work
belongs to a different issue simply gets that issue's name — nothing inherits
the collection name any more. Each repo's commits map to the issue that owns
them.

## 5. Report

Which repos were added, on which branches, whether an init hook ran or was
absent, and whether secrets linked cleanly.

Then **record it in `WTC-SCOPE.md`** — one line saying why that repo is now in
this collection. Pulling a repo in widens the scope, and a scope file that no
longer describes the collection is how one task quietly becomes two
(`instructions/collection-context.md`).
