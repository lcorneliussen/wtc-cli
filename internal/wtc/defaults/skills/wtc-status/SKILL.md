name: wtc-status
description: Report where every worktree collection stands — branches, open PRs and their check rollups, working-tree state, and what is running under the herdr session. Use when the user asks what is in flight, which wtcs exist, what is red or blocked, whether a PR is green, or what they should pick up next.

# Where does everything stand

Use the pinned `wtc status` command to inspect this collection. Status does not change worktree branches or files.

```bash
wtc status                         # live TUI in a terminal; one pass when captured
wtc status --no-watch              # one status pass in a terminal
wtc status --json                  # canonical snapshot JSON
wtc status --md                    # agent Markdown
wtc status --cached                # last snapshot; no Git or forge calls
wtc status --no-fetch              # use current local refs
wtc status --silent                # suppress interactive progress messages
```

Scoped runs write `.wtc-status.json`, `.wtc-status.md`, and the shell-compatible
`.last-wtc-status.yml` in the collection root. `--cached` reports their age and
falls back to a plain listing from the YAML cache when the JSON cache is absent.
Forge failures remain unknown; an empty or cached check is not proof of a
current passing build.
An interactive one-shot run logs elapsed-time collector steps on stderr.
`--silent` suppresses them; JSON, Markdown, and captured output remain clean.
Active PR details use a 90-second forge cache. Once a merge has a real merge
time and settled checks, status records those facts in `.wtc-prs`; later
refreshes do not query that PR again. Merges with unsettled checks or no
merge time continue refreshing after the live cache expires.
`WTC_FORGE_CACHE_AGE` overrides the transient forge cache ages.

## Scope and live views

```bash
wtc status other-collection        # one named collection
wtc status --all                   # every collection, no scoped snapshot files
wtc status --procs                 # processes under the herdr session
wtc status --tui                   # interactive repositories and PRs
wtc status --watch 120             # interactive view, 120-second refresh
```

Bare `wtc status` opens the live view when both input and output are terminals.
Use `--no-watch` for an interactive one-shot table; captured output is already
one-shot. `--all` is explicit because it reads every collection; it omits the
enlisted PR section and does not run other collections' build hooks. The CLI's `--repos`
flag hides the enlisted PR section when a compact table is needed; The interactive
view shows repositories and PRs by default; `--procs` selects the process view.
It starts with the last snapshot while a fresh one loads. Refresh progress
stays on one line so the table does not move; the count remains visible in a
narrow pane. Click “refreshing” or press `l` to open the refresh log; repeated
counts update one entry per stage. The log includes failed ref fetches and the
local-ref fallback. `r` refreshes, `?` shows help, `a` toggles archived PRs,
and `q` quits. It refreshes less
often when unfocused. Captured output prints one pass and exits, so use a
one-shot command to answer a question rather than leaving a watch loop open.
Colored repository names, branches, PR numbers, and build references are
terminal hyperlinks without a permanent underline. Use the terminal's
modifier-click gesture when mouse reporting is active;
ordinary clicks open those targets unless `--no-click` is set. `NO_COLOR`
suppresses styling while retaining the links.
`WTC_STATUS_WATCH`, `WTC_STATUS_WATCH_BG`, and `WTC_STATUS_NO_CLICK` can be set
in `$WTC_CONFIG_ROOT/wtc.env`.

## Read the table

- `⌂ main` is a worktree detached at its development tip, the normal resting
  state. A named branch has work in flight or needs catch-up after its PR lands.
- The repository table shows `±` worktree changes, `↑` ahead, `↓` behind, and
  separate TEST and PROD build columns, even when no build has been reported.
  The footer counts stale worktrees.
- The PR cell combines its number with checks, merge and review facts. `✓`
  means passing or approved; `✗` means failing; `●` means pending; `↓` means
  behind the base; `⚠` means conflicts; `⊘` means blocked; `…` means waiting
  for reviewers; `∅` means no reviewers. Inspect the PR itself before taking
  a merge or review action.
- The PR section lists `.wtc-prs` enlistments in a table, with active rows
  before muted merged rows. `C`, `M`, and `R` mean checks, mergeability, and
  reviews. A merged PR on its old branch calls for catch-up.
  An `unknown` state means the forge lookup was unavailable; it does not prove
  the PR is open. Older merged entries can be hidden behind the `a` toggle.
  The refresh log distinguishes recorded merges from live PR checks.
- TEST and PROD cells show builds supplied by an executable
  `harness/hooks/wtc/status.build.sh`. Their HTTP(S) URLs are
  direct terminal links, and the hook can supply build numbers for GitHub or
  Bitbucket. They are also ordinary mouse targets unless `--no-click` is set.
  The `wtc customize` guide documents the read-only JSON hook contract.

## Answer the actual question

Summarize what is in flight, what is blocked and on whom, and what is green but
waiting. For outside changes, use `wtc-catch-up`. For a PR this session owns,
use `wtc-follow` and verify its current checks, reviews and conversations.
A status-only request does not authorize PR mutations. Merged or archived rows
do not prove delivery is finished; follow main builds and required ports.
