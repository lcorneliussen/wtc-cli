description: Open LazyVim on a worktree collection with one vim tab per sibling so git integrations work. Use when the user wants to look around a collection, browse its files, or open the wtc in nvim. From a terminal it opens in this window; from an agent inside herdr it goes to the browse pane and a gh-dash pr tab. For a text snapshot of branches and PRs, use wtc-status instead.

# Browse a wtc in neovim

One LazyVim, one vim tab per sibling (`:tcd`). Git plugins then see a real
repo. The multi-repo map is `wtc-status`, not this buffer. Not a status
answer — if you need to *say* what is in flight, run `wtc-status`.

## 1. Confirm you are in a collection

A `harness/` next to the siblings, or `harness/AGENTS.md` one level up. The
collection root is the directory holding `harness/`.

## 2. Open it

```bash
harness/tools/wtc-browse.sh                  # this collection
harness/tools/wtc-browse.sh <collection>     # a named one under the workspace root
```

From a terminal (including the herdr `shell` pane) this opens nvim **in
this window**. From an agent pane it sends nvim to the workspace `browse`
pane — never into the agent itself — and opens a `pr` herdr tab with
`gh dash` if that extension is installed. `--here` forces this terminal.

Do not pass `--here` from an agent pane unless the user asked to take it over.

## 3. Leave it alone

nvim uses the alternate screen. Do not `herdr pane read` it to answer a
question, and do not scrape the TUI. The human reads it; you keep working
in your own pane. Status-pane clicks talk to this nvim over its listen
socket. gt / gT (or the tabline) switches siblings.
