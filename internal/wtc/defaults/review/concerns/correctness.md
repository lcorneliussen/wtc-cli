Does the change do what `pr.md` says it does, and does it keep doing what the
code did before where it was not meant to change?

Check, reading the surrounding code and not just the hunks:

- logic errors: wrong condition, inverted check, off-by-one, wrong variable,
  unreachable or dead branch, missing `return`/`break`
- data handling: nulls/empties, types and units, duplicates, ordering,
  time zones, integer vs float, join fan-out or row loss in queries
- error paths: failures swallowed, partial writes, retries that are not
  idempotent, resources not released
- every caller of a changed function, query, or config key still matches its
  new behaviour (grep the repo)
- concurrency and ordering where the code runs more than once or in parallel
- the change is complete: renamed or removed things have no leftover references

Severities:

- **blocker** — wrong results, data loss/corruption, crash or failed run on a
  path that will execute in normal use
- **major** — wrong on a realistic edge case, or an error path that hides
  failures
- **minor** — wrong only on an unlikely input, or a latent bug not reachable
  today
- **nit** — do not use for this concern except for a misleading name or
  comment that will cause a future bug
