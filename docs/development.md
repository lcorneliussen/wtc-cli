# Development and validation

Build with Go 1.27 or newer:

```sh
go build -o wtc ./cmd/wtc
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Running a development build in a collection

When a collection has the wtc-cli repository checked out beside the harness,
build it into the collection with:

```sh
wtc dev install    # builds the wtc-cli sibling into .wtc/dev/wtc
wtc dev status     # which wtc is in effect here
wtc dev uninstall  # back to the pinned release
```

From then on, any `wtc` started inside that collection (a pane, an agent, a
hook; harness-based or ad-hoc) hands over to the dev build, as long as the dev
build is the same version as that `wtc` or newer. The dev build's version comes
from `git describe`: a build three commits past `v0.1.40` is `0.1.41-dev.3`,
above 0.1.40 and below 0.1.41. When the pinned release moves past the build, the
pinned binary runs itself again and notes this on a terminal. Run
`wtc dev install` again after each change. `WTC_DEV_BUILD=off` skips the
handover for one command, and `wtc --version` names the version a dev build
stands in for.

`wtc retire` removes the dev build with the collection.

The dev build is run only if it is an executable owned by you and not writable
by others. Plain `go build` binaries report version `dev` and never hand over.
The handover itself needs a pinned release that includes it (0.1.41 or later).

Tagged releases build macOS and Linux binaries through GoReleaser. Generic
instructions and skills live under `internal/wtc/defaults/` and are embedded
in the CLI. Project-owned overrides belong in harness repositories.

## Runtime integration

The Go suite covers opt-in configuration, read-only status, resource ownership,
lifecycle failures, and retirement. To enable the real runner tests:

```sh
WTC_TEST_DEKIT=/absolute/path/to/dekit go test ./internal/wtc -run TestDekitRuntimeIntegration -v
WTC_TEST_DEKIT=/absolute/path/to/dekit WTC_TEST_DOCKER_IMAGE=postgres:17-alpine go test ./internal/wtc -run TestDekitSharedDockerPostgres -v
```

Use dekit 0.10.0 and pull the supplied Docker image first. The Docker test
creates one disposable container, without host ports, and two synthetic
collection-owned databases. It removes the container and its volumes afterward.
It does not use an existing shared database.

CI verifies the dekit archive checksum and uses a pinned Postgres image digest.
Actual Azure provisioning and connectivity across machines remain onboarding
checks for the project using them.

[Release notes](release-notes.md) are committed and embedded separately from
generated harness guidance. A change that affects behaviour adds its own
fragment, `internal/wtc/release-notes/unreleased/<issue>-<slug>.md`; it never
edits a shared file, so concurrent branches do not conflict over notes. Before
tagging, `go run ./tools/release-notes cut <version>` turns the fragments into
the numbered note; the release workflow publishes that exact file as the
GitHub release body and fails while fragments remain.

[Public demos](demos/README.md) record actual collection and bootstrap commands
against synthetic local repositories. They need no forge account or agent.

## OpenClaw integration tests

`internal/openclaw` holds what `wtc` does under OpenClaw ([guide](openclaw.md)).
Its integration tests drive a throwaway gateway in Docker and are not part of
`go test ./...`:

```sh
go test -tags openclaw_integration ./internal/openclaw/ -v
```

They build a test image from `internal/openclaw/testdata/gateway.Dockerfile`
(the OpenClaw image named by `WTC_OPENCLAW_IMAGE`, a Git and GitHub CLI recent
enough to publish, and `wtc` from this checkout) and run:

- the intent contract against synthetic repositories, with no account at all;
- whole conversations, in which a scripted model
  (`testdata/stub-model.mjs`) makes real agent turns run `wtc` and carry out
  its plans;
- the collection plugin from `openclaw-plugin/`;
- a conversation whose commands run in OpenClaw's Docker sandbox, from an
  image built out of `testdata/sandbox.Dockerfile`. Its gateway gets the
  Docker socket at `/var/run/docker.sock` and keeps its state on the Docker
  host under `/var/lib/wtc-openclaw-e2e/`, because the daemon resolves the
  sandbox's bind mounts there.

Tests that publish need a throwaway repository and a login, and skip without:

| Variables | Test |
|---|---|
| `WTC_OPENCLAW_GITHUB_REPO=<owner>/<repo>`, `GH_TOKEN` | `GitHub`: the gateway commits, pushes and opens a draft pull request |
| `WTC_OPENCLAW_BITBUCKET_REPO=<workspace>/<repo>`, `TWG_BBC_USER`, `TWG_BBC_TOKEN`, `WTC_OPENCLAW_BITBUCKET_SKILL=<checkout of the Bitbucket skill>` | `Bitbucket`: the skill pushes and opens the pull request |
| the GitHub variables | `SandboxedConversation`: a sandboxed agent turn runs `wtc publish` and `github_publish` opens the draft pull request |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the GitHub variables | `RealModel`: an unscripted model, told only where wtc's guidance is, adds a repository and publishes; the test checks the outcome on GitHub |

Logins exist only inside the test container. The tests leave default branches
alone and remove the branches and pull requests they create.
`WTC_OPENCLAW_KEEP=1` leaves the gateway container running for a look inside
(with its sandbox containers and state directory), and `TestNotYetCovered` lists what no test reaches yet.
